# 🚀 React Learning Journey

Welcome to my **React Learning Repository** — a collection of projects and experiments I’m building to master React.js step by step.
Each folder represents a new concept, challenge, or mini-project I’ve completed while learning React.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To deeply understand **React fundamentals**, **component-based architecture**, and **real-world project building** — progressing from beginner to confident React developer.
